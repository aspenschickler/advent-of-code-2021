This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2021 challenges. All problems will be done in Rust.

## Structure

This repository holds two crates, **aoc** and **aoc-lib**, which contain the driver code and individual problems respectively.

## How to Run

In case you are new to [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), I have provided some commands to try this project out yourself.

To run the binary:
```
cargo r
```

to run the test suite:
```
cargo t --lib
```
